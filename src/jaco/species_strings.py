"""
Routines for parsing and manipulating chemical species' string identifiers. All such behaviours should be defined
here - i.e. this is where all of jaco's conventions for writing down chemical formulae should be.

# C_6H_12O_63+ ambiguous: 6 O's with 3+ charge or 63 O's with 1+ charge?
# assume any contiguous number following a _ is the number of the species in the formula, if you want to
# make sure something gets identified as a charge put a ^

- underscores and spaces are valid for readability and latex compatibility, but are ignored in the spec. All should be
compatible with UMIST.
