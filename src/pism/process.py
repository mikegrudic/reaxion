        ----------
        known_quantities: dict
            Dict of symbolic quantities and their values that will be plugged into the network solve as known quantities.
            Can be arrays if you want to substitute multiple values. If T is included here, we solve for chemical
            equilibrium. If T is not included, solve for thermochemical equilibrium.
        guess: dict, optional
            Dict of symbolic quantities and their values that will be plugged into the network solve as guesses for the
            unknown quantities. Can be arrays if you want to substitute multiple values. Will default to trying sensible
            guesses for recognized quantities.
        normalize_to_H: bool, optional
            Whether to return abundances normalized by the number density of H nucleons (default: True)
        reduce_network: bool, optional
            Whether to solve the reduced version of the network substituting conservation laws (default: True)
        tol: float, optional
            Desired relative error in chemical abundances (default: 1e-3)
        careful_steps: int, optional
            Number of careful initial steps in the Newton solve before full step size is used - try increasing this if
